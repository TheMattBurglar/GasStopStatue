There was only one life sized statue on the space station Gas Stop 2, and it was ridiculous.

Being in orbit around the planet Manann (or Manannán mac Lir, if you're being either poetic or pedantic) might not sound like the best place to fuel up. The planet is right there, after all. Why not just grab some gas dirt-side? Hell, a lot of the clientele for Gas Stop 2 literally just blasted off from the surface, so why do they still need fuel? Weight, for one thing. It's cheaper to fuel up once you're in space than to lug all that fuel up the gravity well yourself.  Even if you wanted to do it that way, reasoning that FR-22 wasn't that heavy, you'd need a ship big enough to have the storage needed to make the trip worthwhile, and that would add even more weight, which would need more fuel to lift...etcetera.  It also didn’t hurt that gas was a lot cheaper on Gas Stop 2 than anywhere on Manann. In fact, the stuff was usually exported from the station down to the planet.

The station also boasted a lot of cheap amenities. There was a fast-food court. If you wanted heavily salted and fried potato products, or some meat and condiments held together with bread, you could find that sort of thing there. There was also a Chinese restaurant in the section with the other eateries, but calling it a 'Chinese restaurant' was being rather generous...twice.

The statue, though, was interesting. It was in the area of the station that had the religious chapels. Or, more like alcoves in the wall that were used as chapels. There were five of them. Three to the ancient religions: Christianity, Islam, and Hinduism. Then there were two to the more modern religions of Spiritualism, and Kismet. Between the ancient and modern religious alcoves was a hallway to the bathroom. In that hallway was the statue to Eep, God of Cowards.

Eep was a funny looking god. Tall and lanky, with a body of bronze. The statue was bronze; no one really knew what the god was made of. He was completely naked, held a pair of running shoes in one hand, and carried a bedsheet over the other arm. He looked very uncomfortable, and clearly wanted to put on the shoes and security blanket, but being bronze, he was frozen in place. Exposed.

Robot Kevin walked out of the Kismet Chapel, and saw a woman sitting on the bathroom-waiting-bench across from the Eep statue. He took his stole-of-office off, and proceeded to fold it up as he sat down next to the woman.

"You know, there are three types of people who spend time staring at this statue."

"Keep the sermonizing to yourself, Robot Preacher. I'm just waiting for the bathroom."

"The bathroom is open. You could go in whenever you want. No, I think you like the statue."

"I like the ones where Eep is crouched down, and huddled up in his blanket better. This one seems cruel to him. Like you've stripped him naked just to show him to be a weakling god."

"On the contrary," said Kevin. He slipped his Kismet stole in a pants' pocket. "He's a tall young man, and while he is skinny, his musculature is well defined. He definitely has good legs for running. He may need some bulking up, but I wouldn't call him a weakling. The look on his face, though. The fear of his situation; the fear of being exposed. That is what this statue shows. I think this version is much better than the one where he's just a random Jawa with sneakers on." 

"Cowardice isn't just about fearing exposure. Sometimes it's about running away from the people who need you."

Silence reigned for a heavy minute. "That sounds like something specific."

"Don't push, Robot. I'm not one of your Kismet flock."

"The stole is off. I'm just Kevin right now. A random Robot with an aversion to casting judgments on anyone."

The Woman snorted. "Kismets don't judge, they push."

"Guide. But that's true of Eep too. He's here to help, just like all the gods. Maybe if you told someone about it, he could help. Unless you're afraid of the exposure."

She side eyed him with a scowl. His shiny plastic eyebrows lifted innocently.

"I had a son. He died. I left after that. Happy, now?"

Since the genesis of the 'Z' chromosome, male birth rates had been cut in half. Half the women with the 'Z' chromosome were much more likely to have girls, while the other half simply couldn't have boys at all. Women without the 'Z' chromosome could have boys like normal, but now they only comprised one third of the female population, and a quarter of the total population.

"I see. I'm sorry." He sighed softly...or seemed to breathe in a human way, though actually did nothing of the kind. "I'm from Artemis. I know how hard it can be to have a boy. And how important and life changing it can be when it happens."

"No, you don't. And that's fine. No one should. Men and women; we're supposed to be equal. But we're not. And that's fine too. What's not fine is a mother burying her own baby. That's not fine. It's not fine under any circumstances, and it's worse because I feel like it's worse for me, even though it shouldn't be. It's worse for me because my baby was a boy. A boy I dreamed of becoming the kind of man who'd live up to all the myths of what the men of old used to be. But he couldn't, because of some stupid birth defect. I wasn't a good enough mother to give birth to a healthy baby. It's my fault, and I couldn't take everyone else's 'sympathy' about it. Because it wasn't sympathy, it was disappointment. I saw their hope when I said I was pregnant with a boy, and I saw their disappointment with every crocodile tear. Or what I thought were crocodile tears. I was a bitch to everyone after that. It's better that I left."

Kevin let the silence linger for a bit before he replied, "Then why are you here?"

"Because being a coward is sometimes the right thing. I don't like this statue. Eep is better than this. Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to pee before my ship leaves." She got up, and went into the bathroom at the end of the hall.

Kevin sat silently for a full second after the bathroom door closed. Grief was a funny thing. Everyone deals with it in their own way.

"There are three types of people who spend time staring at this statue. People who just want to look at a naked man. People who are befuddled that there's a statue to the God of Cowards at all. And people who understand, and have something interesting to say about it."

 He opened a chat prompt to the owner of Gas Stop 2: Wizard Gwenhwyfar McGuire Moore.

"Hey Jen! Ever thought of replacing the Naked Eep statue here with a Running Eep instead? I think it might fit with the milieu of this place better."
