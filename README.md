This is a very short story that takes place in the SciFi/Fantasy universe that inspired me to make the Zchrom app.  It goes into slightly more detail about how the Z chromosome has affected humans than the novellas do, but it’s mostly here on GitHub because I don’t see myself ever selling something like this.  As such, I’m putting it out there under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License.  I’ve also included it in the ZchromGUI repository (under the same license).  I haven’t released the novellas yet.  My plan was to have three of them, buddle them together, and release them as a single novel.  Unfortunately, life has gotten in the way, and my ideas for the third story haven't been interesting enough yet to compel me to prioritize it over other things.

I hope you like the story.
